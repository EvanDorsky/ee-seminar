### February 3

We're going to start off with the hysteretic oscillator, a simple circuit with cool and useful behavior. We'll modify it to produce different waveforms and explore some applications of oscillators.

# Day Recap

This recap will cover what we discussed on day 1 and hopefully better explain some of the things I glossed over during the seminar.

## RC Circuit

![RC Circuit]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/day1/rc-circuit.png)

"RC" refers to the resistor (R) and capacitor (C) making up the circuit. The circuit diagram shows how the resistor and capacitor are connected -- the resistor between $$V_{in}$$ and $$V_{out}$$ and the capacitor from $$V_{out}$$ to $$Gnd$$. Different assignments of $$V_{in}$$ and $$V_{out}$$ would lead to different (but related) input/output relationships.

### Qualitative Behavior

The time series plot shows how the RC circuit behaves when $$V_{in}$$ steps from 0V to 1V. In general:

> The output voltage of the RC circuit will decay exponentially towards the input voltage.

Current flows through the resistor and into (or out of) the capacitor as long as the capacitor voltage ($$V_{out}$$) differs from $$V_{in}$$. The greater the difference between $$V_{in}$$ and $$V_{out}$$, the more current flows.

### Quantitative Behavior

![RC Circuit Behavior]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/day1/rc-plot.png)

The capacitor law $$\left(i = C\frac{dV}{dt}\right)$$ tells us that the current through the capacitor is proportional to the change in voltage across the capacitor. Integrating the capacitor law gives us

$$V = \frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^{t_{now}} i\ dt$$

which makes it clear that the voltage across the capacitor is proportional to the total current that has flowed into the capacitor over time. Current will flow through the capacitor until it has charged to the input voltage.

The current through the resistor is the same as the current through the capacitor, so we can write

$$i = \frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{R} = C\frac{dV_{out}}{dt}$$

This yields the differential equation

$$ V_{out} + RC\frac{dV_{out}}{dt} = V_{in}$$

If we take $$V_{in}$$ to be constant with the initial condition $$V_{out}(t=0) = 0$$, we can solve this equation for $$V_{out}(t)$$:

$$ V_{out} = V_{in}\left(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) $$

Solving this differential equation in the time domain is outside the scope of the class (since we're going to adopt a simpler and more powerful method of analyzing circuits soon), but one method of solving this equation is at the end of this recap.

## Schmitt Trigger

![Schmitt Trigger]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/day1/schmitt-circuit.png)
Here's another simple, widespread, and powerful circuit. The Schmitt trigger, named after its inventor (Otto H. Schmitt), is a hysteretic comparator (the next section will explain those terms). We implemented our Schmitt trigger with an op amp and two resistors, but numerous other implementations exist.

### Qualitative Behavior

#### Hysteresis

The Schmitt trigger exhibits hysteresis. From Wikipedia:

> Hysteresis is the time-based dependence of a system's output on present and past inputs.

The explanation of the Schmitt trigger's behavior will expand on this concept with examples.

#### Comparator

A comparator is a circuit with two inputs and one output. Its circuit symbol is similar to the op amp's -- one of the outputs is inverting ($$V_{-}$$) and the other is non-inverting ($$V_{+}$$). A comparator is like an amplifier with infinite gain -- the output is the positive supply rail ($$V_{dd}$$) when $$V_+ > V_-$$ and it's the negative supply rail ($$V_{ss}$$) when $$V_+ < V_-$$.
