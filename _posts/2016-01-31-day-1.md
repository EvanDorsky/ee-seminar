### February 3

We're going to start off with the hysteretic oscillator, a simple circuit with cool and useful behavior. We'll modify it to produce different waveforms and explore some applications of oscillators.

# Day Recap

This recap will cover what we discussed on day 1 and hopefully better explain some of the things I glossed over during the seminar.

## RC Circuit

![RC Circuit]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/day1/rc-circuit.png)

"RC" refers to the resistor (R) and capacitor (C) making up the circuit. The circuit diagram shows how the resistor and capacitor are connected -- the resistor between $$V_{in}$$ and $$V_{out}$$ and the capacitor from $$V_{out}$$ to $$Gnd$$.

### Behavior

The time series plot shows how the RC circuit behaves in this configuration when V<sub>in</sub> steps instantaneously from 0V to 1V. We can derive the differential equation governing this circuit from the device laws. The current through the resistor is the best test of $$ \alpha $$ the same as the current through the capacitor. Thus, we can write
