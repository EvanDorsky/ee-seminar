# Schmitt Trigger

![Schmitt Trigger]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/schmitt-circuit.svg)
Here's another simple, common, and powerful circuit. The Schmitt trigger, named after its inventor (Otto H. Schmitt), is a hysteretic comparator (the next section will explain those terms). We implemented our Schmitt trigger with an op amp and two resistors, but numerous other implementations exist.

## Behavior

Let's find out how the Schmitt trigger behaves by analyzing it with the 3-state-based ideal op amp model. Recall the regions:

- Region 1: $$V_+ > V_-$$ in which $$V_{out} = V_{dd}$$
- Region 2: $$V_+ < V_-$$ in which $$V_{out} = V_{ss}$$
- Region 3: $$V_+ = V_-$$

And note from the circuit diagram that $$V_- = V_{in}$$ and $$V_+ = V_{out}$$.

#### Region 1: $$V_+ > V_-$$

In this region, $$V_{out} = V_{dd}$$. The circuit enforces $$V_+ = aV_{out}$$, so

$$V_+ = aV_{dd}$$.

Plugging this back into the region 1 boundary conditions, we find that region 1 holds if

$$V_{in} < aV_{dd}$$.

#### Region 2: $$V_+ < V_-$$

Following the identical procedure for region 1 we arrive at the boundary conditions

$$V_{in} > aV_{ss}$$.

#### Region 3: $$V_+ = V_-$$

Plugging in $$V_+$$ and $$V_-$$:

$$V_{in} = \frac{1}{a}V_{out}$$
