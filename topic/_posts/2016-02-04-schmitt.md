# Schmitt Trigger

![Schmitt Trigger]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/day1/schmitt-circuit.png)
Here's another simple, widespread, and powerful circuit. The Schmitt trigger, named after its inventor (Otto H. Schmitt), is a hysteretic comparator (the next section will explain those terms). We implemented our Schmitt trigger with an op amp and two resistors, but numerous other implementations exist.

### Qualitative Behavior

#### Hysteresis

The Schmitt trigger exhibits hysteresis. From Wikipedia:

> Hysteresis is the time-based dependence of a system's output on present and past inputs.

The explanation of the Schmitt trigger's behavior will expand on this concept with examples.

#### Comparator

A comparator is a circuit with two inputs and one output. Its circuit symbol is similar to the op amp's -- one of the outputs is inverting ($$V_{-}$$) and the other is non-inverting ($$V_{+}$$). A comparator is like an amplifier with infinite gain -- the output is the positive supply rail ($$V_{dd}$$) when $$V_+ > V_-$$ and it's the negative supply rail ($$V_{ss}$$) when $$V_+ < V_-$$.
