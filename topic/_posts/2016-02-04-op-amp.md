# Operational Amplifier

![Op Amp]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/open-circuit.svg)

The operational amplifier (op amp) is a powerful and versatile device with innumerable applications. The op amp takes two voltages as inputs

- Non-inverting input ($$V_+$$)
- Inverting input ($$V_-$$)

and supplies an output voltage, $$V_{out}$$. Essentially, $$V_{out}=A(V_+ - V_-)$$, where $$A$$ is the _open loop gain_ of the amplifier -- that is, the gain when there is no feedback around the op amp (more on this later).

The op amp is an active element, which means is requires a power supply. Here, it is connected to $$V_{dd}$$ and $$V_{ss}$$.

## Ideal Op Amp

For most applications, the inputs draw so little current (order nanoAmps) and the gain is so high (order $$1,000,000$$) that we can ignore the exact values for both and make these assumptions:

- Infinite gain ($$A\to\infty$$)
- No current into $$V_+$$ or $$V_-$$ ($$R_{in}\to\infty$$)

thus describing the ideal op amp model. This model makes op-amp circuits much easier to analyze while making accurate predictions. When we account for the op amp's power supply (which ensures $$V_{ss} \leq V_{out} \leq V_{dd}$$) and simplify the op amp's inputs to a single input ($$V_{in} = V_+ - V_-$$), we can plot $$V_{out}$$ vs. $$V_{in}$$ as shown below.

### Op Amp Open Loop Behavior

The plot on the right shows the three regions of op amp _open loop_ operation. It is the behavior that $$V_{out}$$ of the op amp on the left would show if $$V_-$$ were fixed between $$V_{dd}$$ and $$V_{ss}$$ and $$V_+$$ was swept. This plot shows the three regions characteristic of the ideal op amp:

- Region 1: $$V_+ > V_-$$ in which $$V_{out} = V_{dd}$$
- Region 2: $$V_+ < V_-$$ in which $$V_{out} = V_{ss}$$
- Region 3: $$V_+ = V_-$$

In the open loop configuration, region 3 is essentially infinitely thin because the open loop gain of the op amp is infinite. To show the power of this model, we can use it to analyze a configuration of the op amp that expands region 3.

### Op Amp as a Buffer

The only difference between this circuit and the above one is that $$V_-$$ and $$V_{out}$$ have been connected. The circuit path between the output ($$V_{out}$$) and the inverting input ($$V_-$$) is called _negative feedback_, and it means that region 3 of the op amp (where $$V_+ = V_-$$) is expanded.

To understand why, consider how the equality $$V_+ = V_-$$ is affected when $$V_- = V_{out}$$. Combining, $$V_+ = V_{out}$$ -- that is, the one free input to the op-amp, $$V_+$$, is equal to the output, $$V_{out}$$. Thus, the $$V_{out}$$ vs. $$V_+$$ plot shows a line with slope 1 (unity) from the negative supply rail to the positive one.
