# Operational Amplifier

The operational amplifier (op amp) is a powerful and versatile device with innumerable applications. The op amp takes two voltages as inputs

- Non-inverting input ($$V_+$$)
- Inverting input ($$V_-$$)

and supplies an output voltage, $$V_{out}$$. Essentially, $$V_{out}=A(V_+ - V_-)$$, where $$A$$ is the _open loop gain_ of the amplifier -- that is, the gain when there is no feedback around the op amp (more on this later).

## Ideal Op Amp

For most applications, the inputs draw so little current (order nanoAmps) and the gain is so high (order $$1,000,000$$) that we can ignore the exact values for both and make these assumptions:

- Infinite gain ($$A\to\infty$$)
- No current into $$V_+$$ or $$V_-$$ ($$R_{in}\to\infty$$)

thus describing the ideal op amp model. This model makes op-amp circuits much easier to analyze while making accurate predictions. When we account for the op amp's power supply (which ensures $$V_{ss} \leq V_{out} \leq V_{dd}$$) and simplify the op amp's inputs to a single input ($$V_{in} = V_+ - V_-$$), we can plot $$V_{out}$$ vs. $$V_{in}$$ as shown.
