# Poorly-explained things

- solution to the RC circuit
- how the schmitt trigger works (unstable equilibrium)
- positive/negative feedback
- how to size components
    + them choosing their own components seems to be working great

# Recap

- started by showing triangle wave on the scope
    + briefly explained scope, demonstrated triggering
- demonstrated wire stripping/sizing method (order?)
- went to the board
    + explained RC circuit
    + explained hysteretic comparator (schmitt trigger)
        * poorly explained positive feedback
- used walking demonstration to explain hysteretic oscillator
    + used it to demonstrate to Paige how the threshold affects frequency!
- set them off to build the hysteretic oscillator
    + had them choose component values
    + explained audible and visible frequencies
        * brief tangent on "visible frequencies"
- warned about minimum resistor value
    + explained why
        + turns out 100Ω is min R for 1/4W@5V so 1kΩ is actually perfect
- set a resistor on fire to show what can happen
    + took way more than 1/4W and coating burns long before resistive material
- explained utility of triangle wave
