# Time and Place

Wednesday 8:00–9:40pm in AC428 (ISIM Lab)

# Course Equipment

- Required
    - Breadboard
    - Breadboard power supply
    - Wire stripper/cutter
    - Analog Discovery
- Nice to have
    - Needle-nose pliers
    - USB-A cable

Recommended: [Leatherman Squirt ES4][lsquirt] (miniature wire stripper/cutter and needle-nose pliers moonlighting as a multi-tool).

There are some wire strippers in AC428 but probably not enough for everyone.

Hopefully you all still have your breadboards and power supplies -- but I have some extra breadboards and there are some power supplies in the lab.

I'd like to use oscilloscopes but bring your Analog Discovery's for now, since there aren't enough scopes.

# Plan of Study

The independent study will consist of about 12 weekly 100-minute sessions with little to no required outside work. Students will build practical circuits while learning about related electrical engineering concepts. Their work will culminate in a multi-week final project, drawing on the skills and knowledge they have gained over the course of the semester.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop systematic debugging and problem solving skills
    + Learn to use the oscilloscope as a powerful debugging aid
- Learn about and construct useful circuits in common categories
    + Oscillators
    + Transistor (BJT, MOSFET) load drivers
        * Inductive (motors, solenoids)
        * Semiconductor (LEDs)
        * Resistive (speakers)
    + Other useful transistor subcircuits
    + Op-amp circuits
    + Power supplies
        * Linear
        * Switching
    + MOSFET logic circuits
- Understand passive and active device behavior, nonidealities, uses, and design considerations
    + Active
        * Op amps
        * Transistors
            - BJTs
            - MOSFETs
    + Passive
        * Resistors
        * Capacitors
        * Inductors
        * Diodes
            - Silicon/Schottky
            - Zener
