# Course Equipment

- Required
    - Breadboard
    - Breadboard power supply
    - Wire stripper/cutter
- Nice to have
    - Needle-nose pliers

Recommended: [Leatherman Squirt ES4][lsquirt] (miniature wire stripper/cutter and needle-nose pliers moonlighting as a multi-tool).

There are some wire strippers in AC428 but probably not enough for everyone.

Hopefully you all still have your breadboards and power supplies -- I have some extra breadboards but no power supplies.

# Learning Objectives

- Develop systematic debugging and problem solving skills
    + Learn to use the oscilloscope as a powerful debugging aid
- Learn about and construct useful circuits in common categories
    + Oscillators
    + Transistor (BJT, MOSFET) load drivers
        * Inductive (motors, solenoids)
        * Semiconductor (LEDs)
        * Resistive (speakers)
    + Other useful transistor subcircuits
    + Op-amp circuits
    + Linear power supplies
    + MOSFET logic circuits
- Understand passive and active device behavior, nonidealities, uses, and design considerations
    + Active
        * Op amps
        * Transistors
            - BJTs
            - MOSFETs
    + Passive
        * Resistors
