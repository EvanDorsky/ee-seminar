# Plan of Study

This independent study is set up like a class -- a proto-student seminar. I (Evan Dorsky) will instruct a number of students, some of whom are pursuing credit. I am also pursuing credit for the instruction of this "course".

The independent study will consist of about 12 weekly 100-minute sessions with little to no required outside work. Students will build practical circuits while learning about related electrical engineering concepts. Their work will culminate in a multi-week final project, drawing on the skills and knowledge they have gained over the course of the semester.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop systematic debugging and problem solving skills
    + Learn to use the oscilloscope as a powerful debugging aid
- Learn about and construct useful circuits in common categories
    + Oscillators
    + Transistor (BJT, MOSFET) load drivers
        * Inductive (motors, solenoids)
        * Semiconductor (LEDs)
        * Resistive (speakers)
    + Other useful transistor subcircuits
    + Op-amp circuits
    + Power supplies
        * Linear
        * Switching
    + MOSFET logic circuits
- Understand passive and active device behavior, nonidealities, uses, and design considerations
    + Active
        * Op amps
        * Transistors
            - BJTs
            - MOSFETs
    + Passive
        * Resistors
        * Capacitors
        * Inductors
        * Diodes
            - Silicon/Schottky
            - Zener

## Assessment

Students will be assessed based on their grasp of the concepts and the quality of their circuits, including their final project.
